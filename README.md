## YOLOV7  
To detect the location of the car license plate in the images, Yolov7 pre-trained model were used. Here is the short description of this high-performing model:

### Performance
Yolov7 was introduced in July 2022 and outperforms other object detection models in terms of accuracy and speed. In the image below, Yolov7 performance is compared to other well-known object detectors:

### Architecture
Yolov7 model was trained on MS COOC dataset and no pre-trained weights were used for training

In Yolov7 architecture, Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN) were used which leads the model to learn more features. Moreover, the architecture of Yolov7 has scaled by concatenating other models such as YOLO-R which can address different speeds for inference. Thanks to bag-of-freebies, Yolov7 has better accuracy without any increment in the inference speed
